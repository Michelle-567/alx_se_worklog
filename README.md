My monthly developer log as part of the ALX SE program

# 🗓️ Monthly Dev Log – April/May

Welcome to my monthly reflection as part of the **ALX Software Engineering** journey!

## 🚀 What I Worked On
- Learned Python basics: variables, data types, arithmetic, user input
- Created beginner scripts:
  - Rectangle area calculator
  - Hours-to-seconds converter
  - Future age calculator
  - Monthly finance projection with simple interest
- Practiced version control with Git
- Used GitHub to store and share projects

## 🐞 Bugs I Solved
- Handled invalid input formatting in Python
- Fixed Git merge conflicts when working with branches
- Corrected logic errors in interest and age calculations

## 🏆 Achievements
- Wrote multiple working Python scripts
- Developed confidence using Git and GitHub
- Built and documented all Python introduction tasks
- Completed all mandatory projects on time

## ❌ What Didn't Go Well & What I Learned
- Initially struggled with Git branches and merge conflicts  
  ✅ Learned how to resolve them and now use branching confidently  
- Took longer to understand compound interest logic  
  ✅ Broke it down and implemented it step-by-step

## ✨ Monthly Highlights
- Realizing how much progress I’ve made in just a few weeks
- Posting my journey publicly and starting to grow my tech network
- Starting to feel like a real developer 😄
